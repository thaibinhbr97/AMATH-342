# AMATH-342: Computational Methods for Differential Equations

This is the resporitory that showcases my work in AMATH 342: Computational Methods for Differential Equations at University of Waterloo in Canada.

Code is conducted mainly in MatLab.

# Brief Introduction
Mathematical models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are ubiquitous these days, arising in all areas of science and engineering, and also in finance and economics. In complex models, the differential equations cannot be solved exactly, and one has to rely on approximate solutions obtained using numerical methods on computers.

The goal of this course is threefold. You will receive a solid introduction to the theory of numerical methods for differential equations (with derivations of the methods and some proofs). You will learn to implement the computational methods efficiently in Matlab, and you will apply the methods to problems in several fields, for example, climate modeling, combustion, control theory, and mathematical biology.

# Course Description

An introduction to numerical methods for ordinary and partial differential equations. Ordinary differential equations: multistep and Runge-Kutta methods; stability and convergence; systems and stiffness; boundary value problems. Partial differential equations: finite difference methods for elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic equations; stability and convergence. The course focuses on introducing widely used methods and highlights applications in the natural sciences, the health sciences, engineering, and finance.
